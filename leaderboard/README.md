# Leaderboard app

My first meteor app. Made this app while reading "Your First Meteor Application - A Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Meteor.js"
by David Turnbull

Find it on: http://meteortips.com/

Allows you to create user accounts, login and make your private list.
You can add/remove players to a list and give them points.
List is sorted by points.

Only logged in users have access to the controls.
A user does not see lists created by others.

Test it on the METEORpad:
