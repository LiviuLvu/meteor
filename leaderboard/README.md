# Leaderboard app

My first meteor app. Made this app while reading "Your First Meteor Application - A Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Meteor.js"
by David Turnbull

Find it on: http://meteortips.com/


This app allows you to create user accounts, login.
You can add/remove players to a list and give them points.

The players list is sorted by points.
Only logged in users have access to the controls.
A user does not see lists created by others.

You can see this app on the METEORpad:
